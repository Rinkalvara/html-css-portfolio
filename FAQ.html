        1. What is social media marketing? 
Social media marketing (SMM) is a type of Internet marketing where companies market their products or services using social networking websites and mobile applications. These platforms allow consumers to share opinions about brands directly with others who they know socially. In addition, these sites provide analytics tools to track consumer engagement. There are different types of online communities, including Facebook groups, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and blogs; each may require its own set of unique tags. Each platform provides its users various ways to interact with the network such as posting comments, uploading content, sharing images/videos, blogging, messaging friends, voting, commenting on other people’s posts, and many more.

While these forms of advertisements still exist today, they are not effective in communicating effectively with modern audiences. In comparison, social media provides marketers with a way to connect directly with consumers through online communities. Through social networks, businesses can post content, build trust, and receive feedback about their product or service. These interactions can lead to sales if done correctly.
